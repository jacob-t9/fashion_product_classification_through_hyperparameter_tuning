# Datasheet Template

## Motivation

Purpose: The Fashion MNIST dataset was created for the purpose of serving as a replacement for the traditional MNIST handwritten digit dataset. It was designed to provide a more challenging and diverse dataset for benchmarking and testing machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of image classification.

Creators: The Fashion MNIST dataset was curated by Zalando Research and is made available as a research dataset. It is not associated with a specific team or research group but is attributed to Zalando Research.

Funding: The dataset was created and made available by Zalando Research, a division of Zalando SE, a European e-commerce company.

 
## Composition

Representation: The instances in the dataset represent grayscale images of various fashion product items, such as clothing and accessories.

Number of Instances: The dataset contains a total of 70,000 instances, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Missing Data: There is no missing data in the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Confidential Data: The dataset does not contain data that might be considered confidential, as it consists of publicly available images of fashion products.

## Collection process

Data Acquisition: The data for the Fashion MNIST dataset was collected by scraping and curating images from various publicly available sources on the internet.

Sampling Strategy: The dataset is not a sample of a larger subset, it was made as a standalone dataset.

Time Frame: The exact time frame for data collection is not specified.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

Preprocessing: The data is provided as grayscale images of 28x28 pixels. No additional preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling was performed on the images.

Raw Data: The raw image data is not publicly available as part of the dataset. Only the preprocessed dataset, with labels, is distributed.
 
## Uses

Other Potential Uses: Apart from image classification, the dataset can be used for tasks such as feature extraction, transfer learning, and model benchmarking in computer vision.

Impact on Future Uses: While the dataset itself does not contain sensitive or confidential information, it is essential for users to be aware of potential bias in model training and evaluation due to variations in image quality, lighting, and background in fashion product images. Users should be cautious when applying models trained on this dataset to real-world applications to avoid unfair treatment or stereotyping of individuals or groups.

Inappropriate Uses: The dataset should not be used for tasks unrelated to image classification, and caution should be exercised when using it for applications where fairness, privacy, or ethical considerations are concerned.

## Distribution

Distribution History: The Fashion MNIST dataset has been widely distributed and is publicly available for research and educational purposes. It can be accessed through various machine learning libraries and online platforms.

Copyright/IP License: The Fashion MNIST dataset is distributed under the MIT License, which allows for its use, modification, and redistribution, subject to certain conditions. It is intended for non-commercial use.

## Maintenance

Dataset Maintenance: The Fashion MNIST dataset is maintained and hosted by Zalando Research, the organization that created and released the dataset. It is accessible through various online repositories and machine learning frameworks. Any updates or changes to the dataset would be managed by Zalando Research.
